      question: "Is this just another project management tool?",
      answer: "No! Project Graveyard is specifically designed for abandoned projects. Instead of helping you manage active work, we help you learn from dead projects to make better future decisions."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to connect my GitHub account?",
      answer: "Not for the beta! You can manually add projects to get started. GitHub integration is coming in a future update to automatically detect abandoned repositories."
    },
    {
      question: "Will other people see my failed projects?",
      answer: "Your graveyard is completely private by default. Only you can see your buried projects and insights. We may add optional sharing features later, but privacy is our priority."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you define an 'abandoned' project?",
      answer: "Any project you're no longer actively working on and don't plan to return to. It could be a side project, startup idea, learning exercise, or experiment that didn't pan out."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want to revive a dead project?",
      answer: "Perfect! The platform will help you understand why it died originally and provide insights on whether revival makes sense. You can track revival attempts and their outcomes too."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost?",
      answer: "The beta is completely free! We're focused on building the best possible product and gathering feedback. Pricing will come later, and beta users will get special benefits."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of insights will I get?",
      answer: "You'll see patterns in why projects fail (scope, timing, tech choices), which technologies correlate with completion, seasonal trends in your productivity, and personalized recommendations for future projects."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export my data?",
      answer: "Yes! You own your data. You can export all your project information, post-mortems, and insights at any time. No vendor lock-in."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this meant to make me feel bad about failed projects?",
      answer: "Absolutely not! The goal is to transform guilt into growth. Every buried project becomes a lesson that makes you a better developer. We celebrate learning from failure."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the beta last?",
      answer: "The beta will run for several months while we gather feedback and improve the product. Beta users will get advanced notice before any major changes or pricing announcements."
