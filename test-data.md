## Project 1: Weekend Warrior Pattern
**Project Details:**
- **Name**: `TodoApp Supreme`
- **Description**: `The ultimate todo app with AI integration and smart prioritization`
- **Death Date**: `2024-07-22` (Monday - 3 days after weekend start)
- **Death Cause**: `Lost Interest`
- **Tech Stack**: `React, Node.js, MongoDB`
- **Epitaph**: `Started with enthusiasm, died with Monday blues`

**Post-Mortem:**
- **What problem were you trying to solve?**: `I wanted to build a smart todo app that could automatically prioritize tasks using AI and help people be more productive. The idea was to create something better than existing apps by making it really intelligent about what tasks matter most.`

- **What went wrong?**: `I started this on a Saturday morning full of energy and excitement. Built the basic React components and got the database connected. But by Monday, I realized there are literally hundreds of todo apps already. I lost all motivation and just stopped working on it. The weekend energy completely disappeared.`

- **What did you learn?**: `Weekend projects need sustainable momentum beyond just initial excitement. I should validate that people actually want another todo app before building it. Also learned that my motivation patterns are tied to weekends - need to account for that energy drop on weekdays.`

## Project 2: Scope Creeper Pattern
**Project Details:**
- **Name**: `E-commerce Empire`
- **Description**: `Complete marketplace platform with payments, analytics, ML recommendations, and inventory management`
- **Death Date**: `2024-06-15` (3 weeks after creation)
- **Death Cause**: `Over-scoped`
- **Tech Stack**: `Next.js, PostgreSQL, Stripe, TensorFlow, Redis, Docker, AWS`
- **Epitaph**: `Dreamed too big, delivered too little`

**Post-Mortem:**
- **What problem were you trying to solve?**: `Small businesses need an affordable e-commerce platform that's as powerful as Shopify but more customizable. I wanted to build the complete solution with everything they'd need - payments, analytics, inventory, ML-powered recommendations, multi-vendor support.`

- **What went wrong?**: `I kept adding more and more features to the plan. Started with a simple shopping cart, then added user authentication, then payment processing, then analytics dashboard, then ML recommendations, then inventory management, then multi-vendor support. Never actually finished the core shopping cart because I was always thinking about the next big feature to add.`

- **What did you learn?**: `Start with MVP and one feature at a time. Don't try to build Amazon on day one. Each additional feature multiplies complexity exponentially. Better to have one working feature than ten half-built features. Scope creep kills projects faster than technical issues.`

## Project 3: Serial Starter Pattern  
**Project Details:**
- **Name**: `Quick Chat App`
- **Description**: `Simple real-time messaging app for teams`
- **Death Date**: `2024-06-16` (1 day after Project 2 died)
- **Death Cause**: `Better Solution Existed`
- **Tech Stack**: `Vue.js, Firebase, Socket.io`
- **Epitaph**: `Discord already exists`

**Post-Mortem:**
- **What problem were you trying to solve?**: `Teams need a lightweight chat app that's simpler than Slack but more powerful than basic messaging. Just focused real-time communication without all the bloat.`

- **What went wrong?**: `Literally the day after abandoning my e-commerce project, I jumped into this. Spent a few hours setting up Vue and Firebase, then realized Discord, Slack, Teams, and dozens of other chat apps already solve this perfectly. Why would anyone use mine?`

- **What did you learn?**: `I have a pattern of immediately starting new projects after abandoning old ones. Need to take time to reflect and process what went wrong before jumping to the next idea. Also need to do competitive research before building, not after.`

## Project 4: Framework Hopper Pattern
**Project Details:**
- **Name**: `Portfolio Site v3`
- **Description**: `My personal portfolio website with dark mode and animations`
- **Death Date**: `2024-06-20` (4 days after Project 3)
- **Death Cause**: `Technical Roadblock`
- **Tech Stack**: `Svelte, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion`
- **Epitaph**: `CSS animations are harder than I thought`

**Post-Mortem:**
- **What problem were you trying to solve?**: `My current portfolio looks outdated and doesn't show my skills well. Wanted to rebuild it with modern tech stack and smooth animations to impress potential employers.`

- **What went wrong?**: `Decided to try Svelte since I'd been using React and Vue in previous projects. Spent more time learning Svelte than actually building the portfolio. Then got stuck on complex CSS animations and couldn't get them to work smoothly. Felt like I was fighting the framework instead of making progress.`

- **What did you learn?**: `I keep switching frameworks instead of getting really good at one. Jack of all trades, master of none. Sometimes the problem isn't the tech stack, it's my lack of deep knowledge in any single stack. Should master React before moving to Vue, Svelte, etc.`

## Project 5: Perfectionist Paralysis Pattern
**Project Details:**
- **Name**: `Habit Tracker Pro`
- **Description**: `Advanced habit tracking with detailed analytics and behavioral insights`
- **Death Date**: `2024-05-10` (2 weeks of planning, minimal coding)
- **Death Cause**: `Lost Interest`
- **Tech Stack**: `React Native, SQLite, Chart.js`
- **Epitaph**: `Perfect plan, zero execution`

**Post-Mortem:**
- **What problem were you trying to solve?**: `Existing habit trackers are too simple. I wanted to build one with detailed analytics, streak analysis, behavioral pattern recognition, and personalized insights to help people actually stick to their habits long-term.`

- **What went wrong?**: `Spent two weeks creating detailed wireframes, writing comprehensive documentation, planning the database schema, researching behavioral psychology, and outlining all the features. When I finally started coding, I had only written about 50 lines of actual code before losing interest. The planning felt like work, but it wasn't actually building anything.`

- **What did you learn?**: `Planning is procrastination in disguise. Need to start coding sooner and iterate based on real usage rather than trying to design the perfect system upfront. Documentation should follow working code, not precede it. Balance planning with doing.`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Create Account**: Sign up with test email
2. **Create Projects**: Add all 5 projects in order (this simulates realistic timeline)
3. **Add Post-Mortems**: Copy and paste the post-mortem content for each project
4. **Trigger Analysis**: Go to graveyard page and click "Analyze My Patterns"
5. **Expected Patterns**: Should detect weekend_warrior, scope_creeper, serial_starter, framework_hopper, perfectionist_paralysis
6. **Test AI Insights**: Generate AI insights for projects with post-mortems
7. **Verify Dashboard**: Check that pattern dashboard shows all detected patterns and insights

This test data should trigger multiple pattern detection algorithms and provide rich content for AI analysis.
